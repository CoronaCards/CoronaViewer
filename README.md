# CoronaViewer (for CoronaCards)

CoronaViewer lets you edit the contents of a `CoronaView` instance and preview those code changes in __real-time__ on your __device__. 

In this workflow, your native app does not have to be recompiled/relinked/reinstalled onto the device. You can edit your Lua code from your desktop editor/IDE and your Corona-related project files will automatically sync and update in the corresponding `CoronaView` in your native app. (This also works with apps you build in the Xcode Simulator.)

NOTE: [Corona SDK/Enterprise](http://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/) developers should go [here](https://github.com/coronalabs/CoronaViewer).

## Project setup

## Code Integration

There are several simple steps:

1. Add `CoronaViewer.framework` to your Xcode project.
2. Use `CoronaViewerController` instead of `CoronaViewController` (note the 'er' in 'Viewer'). It's a drop-in replacement.
3. Disable your call to the `run` or `runWithPath:parameters:` selector of your `CoronaView` instance.
4. Instead, you run via the controller. Specifically, call `CoronaViewerController`'s `run` selector.
5. Ensure that launch url's are handled correctly by adding the following to your implementation of the  `UIApplicationDelegate`:

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)source annotation:(id)annotation
{
	return [CoronaViewerController handleOpenURL:url];
}
```

`6`. Modify your `Info.plist` so that Dropbox can interact with CoronaViewer properly:

```
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
		<array>
			<string>db-l1q0pln8qsi8qyp</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```


### Dropbox

CoronaViewer requires a [Dropbox](https://db.tt/uQgIqtPN) account. You'll need to install the Dropbox plugin on your desktop computer.

### Where Files Go

Your Corona project files (e.g. `main.lua`) should go in the following location in order to be shared:

	${DROPBOX_FOLDER}/Apps/CoronaViewer

NOTE: Only files in this location will be synchronized with your device. The rest of your Dropbox folder is __not__ visible to CoronaViewer.

### Running on device

Build the Corona project in this repo and install it on your device. ([Corona Enterprise](http://coronalabs.com/products/enterprise/) users, see below for additional info.)

You'll be prompted with Dropbox's standard login interface:

![Dropbox Login UI iOS](README/dropbox-login-ios.png)

This enables the app to synchronize with your Corona project files (i.e. files that are in the above location.)

#### Xcode Simulator

You can also build this app for the Xcode Simulator instead of for your device.
